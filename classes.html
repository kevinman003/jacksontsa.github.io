           The AP Psychology course introduces students to the
systematic and scientific study of human behavior and
mental processes. While considering the psychologists
and studies that have shaped the field, students explore
and apply psychological theories, key concepts, and
phenomena associated with such topics as the biological
bases of behavior, sensation and perception, learning and
cognition, motivation, developmental psychology, testing
and individual differences, treatment of abnormal behavior,
and social psychology. Students employ psychological
research methods, including ethical considerations, as they
use the scientific method, analyze bias, evaluate claims
and evidence, and effectively communicate ideas.

            Designed for students in the Graphic Design pathway,
Introduction to Graphic Design covers the basic art concepts
for studio work, layout and composition, aesthetics, and
history. Students apply techniques, graphic arts vocabulary,
tools and equipment, color theory, perspective, drawing,
and painting. Graphic art styles and techniques with a
strong emphasis on design are presented to the student and
include computer assisted art and design using vector and
raster graphics, concept sketching, illustrations, traditional
art medias, digital imaging, communication skills, and
commercial art business operations. Students develop
visual presentations skills and build personal portfolios.

           Graphic Design II is a continued, advanced study of
Graphics Arts I. Concept development procedures in
visual communication problems are developed for graphic
art problems. Vector graphics, raster optics, layout, and
design are used in single compositions. Students begin
work in 3-D modeling and 2-D animation concepts, and are
introduced to 3-D animation. Students create storyboards
and computer models for animated and still illustrations
with polygons and NURBS constructions (Flash, Rhino,
MAYA). Students will be given a choice of working in
2-D or 3-D graphics. Emphasis is on the principles of art,
organization, production techniques, and building a portfolio.

         The AP Studio Art classes are year-long art courses that
guide students through the process of creating a college
level portfolio of artwork - usually 15-25 pieces. Portfolio
assignments are designed to showcase the breadth and
growth of student skill and knowledge in art, and demonstrate
student voice and creativity through a concentration of
fi ve or more pieces done on one subject or theme. Finished
Porfolios are eligible for college credit when the AP Studio
Art exam is taken. Portfolios are also used for entry into
art programs at the college level. The best quality pieces
from student portfolios can be entered into art shows and
competitions for awards and scholorship opportunities.
